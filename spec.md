# COBOL "Hello World" Program Specification

## Summary

This document outlines the implementation of a basic "Hello World" program in COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), as requested. The program demonstrates the fundamental structure of COBOL and produces a simple text output.

## COBOL Overview

- COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language first developed in 1959
- Primarily used for business, finance, and administrative systems
- Features English-like syntax designed to be self-documenting
- Still widely used in legacy systems, particularly in banking, insurance, and government sectors

## Technical Specifications

### Program Structure

A standard COBOL program consists of four divisions:

1. **IDENTIFICATION DIVISION** - Contains program identification information
2. **ENVIRONMENT DIVISION** - Describes the computing environment
3. **DATA DIVISION** - Declares data and file structures
4. **PROCEDURE DIVISION** - Contains executable statements

### Hello World Implementation

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. HELLO.
       
       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
       
       DATA DIVISION.
       
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           DISPLAY "Hello, World!".
           STOP RUN.
```

## Key Technical Points

- COBOL code is traditionally written in uppercase
- Programs are column-sensitive with specific areas for line numbers and code
- Periods (`.`) are statement terminators
- The `DISPLAY` verb outputs text to the standard output device
- `STOP RUN` terminates program execution

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run using GnuCOBOL (a common open-source COBOL compiler):

```bash
# Save the code to hello.cob
# Compile the program
cobc -x hello.cob

# Execute the program
./hello
```

Expected output:
```
Hello, World!
```

## Conclusion

This specification provides a minimal implementation of a COBOL "Hello World" program that demonstrates the basic structure and syntax of the COBOL programming language.
